note: if you're trying to build a new `Unnamed` consider using one of the following associated functions:
      _::<impl Unnamed>::empty
      _::<impl Unnamed>::all
      _::<impl Unnamed>::from_bits
      _::<impl Unnamed>::from_bits_truncate
      and $N others

  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__impl_bitflags` which comes from the expansion of the macro `bitflags` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
